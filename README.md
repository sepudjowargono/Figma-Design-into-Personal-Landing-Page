# 🎨 Personal Portfolio Landing Page — Figma to Code Conversion

This project is a custom-branded personal portfolio landing page built by transforming a provided **Figma design** into clean, responsive HTML and CSS. It demonstrates modern front-end development skills including layout analysis, design replication, and responsiveness.

By rebranding the template with my own content, images, and branding, this project serves as a showcase of both **technical ability** and **visual design execution**.
